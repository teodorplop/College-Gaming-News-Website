			<img src = "resources/best/childoflight.jpg" class = "nominated_picture"/>
			<h3 class = "nominated_description_title">Child of Light</h3>
			<p class = "nominated_description">Every aspect of Child of Light has an unmistakably artisinal, organic feel to it. None of it feels focus-tested, or designed to appeal to the broadest possible audience; rather, 
			it always comes off as exactly the expression its creators intended. The artwork on display is stunning, and the combat is constantly engaging, and the characters openly defy genre convention. 
			But perhaps the best thing I can say about Child of Light is that I was often unsure as to whether I was headed in the direction I was supposed to, and I never once cared. I just wanted to fly to every 
			corner of the world, take it in, and smile.

			<h3 class = "nominated_description_title">Dark Souls II</h3>
			<p class = "nominated_description">Dark Souls II is a smart, massive, and incredibly rewarding sequel. It’s crammed with deep systems, tense encounters, and enough clever 
			multiplayer and New Game Plus elements to make me want to restart the second I saw the end credits. Not all of the tweaks and additions worked out for the best, but with such
			great enemies and levels to fight and explore, Dark Souls II made 60 hours of pain and agony so much fun they flew by in a heartbeat.

			<img src = "resources/best/divinity.jpg" class = "nominated_picture"/>
			<h3 class = "nominated_description_title">Divinity: Original Sin</h3>
			<p class = "nominated_description">Original Sin is one of the most rewarding RPGs to come along in years. Its quests and combat compelled me to think hard about my actions and choices, 
			which is more than I usually get to say about contemporary RPGs. Its depth, personality, and combat challenges easily allow it to hold its own against the likes of heavyweights like Dragon
			Age: Origins. These systems invite constant experimentation throughout dozens of memorable hours of combat and cheeky storytelling, and its rich modding toolkit provides the framework for 
			enjoyable player-made adventure for years to come.

			<img src = "resources/best/dragonage.jpg" class = "winner_picture"/>
			<h3 class = "winner_description_title">Dragon Age: Inquisition</h3>
			<p class = "winner_description">Dragon Age: Inquisition delivered the most complete and satisfying RPG experience of 2014. Each of the 13 regions are expansive, 
			beautiful, and full of lore, loot, and side quests that greatly compliment the main campaign. The nine companions’ unique skill sets, witty banter, and intriguing backstories 
			make exploring the regions an absolute joy, and even more so when you take them into battle. Experimenting with party combinations and the tactical mode makes fighting enemies 
			incredibly satisfying and let’s you play the game as strategically as you’d like. Dragon Age: Inquisition’s flexible gameplay and vast world make for the best RPG of 2014.

			<img src = "resources/best/destiny.jpg" class = "nominated_picture"/>
			<h3 class = "nominated_description_title">Destiny</h3>
			<p class = "nominated_description">Reviewed on September 3 Simplistic “it’s like X mixed with Y” comparisons don’t really add up when attempting to explain what Destiny is, or why 
			it’s worth playing. It borrows from many well-established gaming destinations, but the climate of each is wildly different, and often incompatible. It’s a complex production that boils 
			down simply to this: Destiny is a mechanically excellent, visually evocative FPS housed within an under-developed RPG framework. The endgame might hook you for the long haul once you 
			fully understand it, but Destiny is ultimately unable to be all the different games it’s trying so hard to be.

			<img src = "resources/best/titanfall.jpg" class = "nominated_picture"/>
			<h3 class = "nominated_description_title">Titanfall</h3>
			<p class = "nominated_description">Reviewed on March 10 Titanfall represents a potent fusion of established and modern design ideas, creating a tense and rewarding balance of 
			power and moment-to-moment unpredictability. MOBA-like minions mix with traditional on-foot deathmatch, jetpack-powered locomotion, and giant-robot combat – each role playing its 
			own part in the battle and coming with its own tactics and strategies – while the well-designed maps make the ideal weapons and loadout completely situational and dynamic. Though 
			Titanfall is somewhat regrettably a barebones game in terms of modes and customization features available at launch, its intense action is almost as exciting to watch a friend play as 
			it is to pick up the controller yourself. It’s surprisingly lacking many accoutrements we’ve come to expect in a multiplayer shooter, but it nevertheless unites its elements in a cohesive, 
			approachable way. Titanfall earns a seat at the table with the genre’s entrenched powerhouses.

			<h3 class = "nominated_description_title">Call of Duty: Advanced Warfare</h3>
			<p class = "nominated_description">Reviewed on November 3 Simply throwing a robot suit onto Call of Duty could have been a lazy path to making Advanced Warfare seem different from what 
			we’ve played before, but the way Sledgehammer has integrated its enhanced abilities and choices into every aspect of how we fight went above and beyond. By designing the levels in the 
			campaign, co-op, and multiplayer to facilitate those new mechanics, Advanced Warfare is granted a weight and importance that changes how the fast-paced shooting action feels in all three 
			modes. This is a Call of Duty game to its core, but one that rehashes as little as possible while still retaining its strengths.

			<h3 class = "winner_description_title">Far Cry 4</h3>
			<p class = "winner_description">Reviewed on November 14 Far Cry 4’s open-ended combat freedom remains the series’ greatest strength. Whether you’re attacking from the bushes with a bow, 
			dropping C4 from a gyrocopter, burning fields to draw out enemies, unloading bullets with a hefty LMG, or riding an elephant through their front door, there’s immense diversity in how you 
			fight foes in Far Cry 4.The situations you find yourself in can often change your approach, as well. Attacking an outpost often differs from sieging a fortress, escaping a prison, or 
			destroying a propaganda factory. Far Cry 4 forces improvisation and adaptability, and how you respond to the flow of its unpredictable combat. This is true online as well, where more 
			supernatural weaponry creates a compelling disparity between two teams with distinct combat skills.Far Cry 4’s player progression and shooter combat — whether it’s with guns, bows, or 
			other weaponry — is among the genre’s best.

			<img src = "resources/best/bannersaga.jpg" class = "nominated_picture"/>
			<h3 class = "nominated_description_title">Banner Saga</h3>
			<p class = "nominated_description">Reviewed on January 14 The Banner Saga deserves commendation for the strength of its art and music experience alone, which shatters conventions. 
			That experience, in turn, complements a bleak story of a world teetering before its fall, where the harshness of the Scandinavian landscape mirrors the plight of mutually distrustful 
			refugees. It's also a tough tactical RPG that rewards thought and careful strategy, although it stumbles a bit in explaining systems beyond its combat.

			<h3 class = "nominated_description_title">Defense Grid 2</h3>
			<p class = "nominated_description">Reviewed on October 14 Defense Grid 2’s new variations on the original’s excellent tower defense gameplay pulled me right back into the compulsively 
			addictive quest to destroy all aliens with a minimum of expenditure. I don’t recommend the multiplayer and the story doesn’t even compare to the standard set by the original, but its 20 
			maps absolutely scratch that same itch – and provide lots of tools to keep that momentum going for a long while.

			<img src = "resources/best/endlesslegend.jpg" class = "nominated_picture"/>
			<h3 class = "nominated_description_title">Endless Legend</h3>
			<p class = "nominated_description">Reviewed on September 23 Endless Legend plays out on one of the greatest, most beautiful maps in strategy gaming history. 
			It combines style, substance, and setting into a marvelous overall experience for both empire management and tactical combat. It struggles slightly with strategic 
			depth, but this is a science fiction and fantasy strategy game with tremendous soul.

			<h3 class = "winner_description_title">Hearthstone</h3>
			<p class = "winner_description">Reviewed on March 13The explosion of competitive play for Hearthstone: Heroes of Warcraft in 2014 is a testament to its addicting nature and satisfying 
			strategy. Hearthstone’s easy to understand yet refined core rules make it incredibly accessible to those uninitiated to digital card games. Still, that doesn’t mean we perfected our 
			decks after a few matches. With 535 well-balanced collectable cards and nine playable classes, there’s enormous potential for intricate strategies. After hundreds of games we’re still 
			discovering new ways to arrange our decks to slaughter our opponents in battle.

			<img src = "resources/best/fifa.jpg" class = "nominated_picture"/>
			<h3 class = "nominated_description_title">FIFA 15</h3>
			<p class = "nominated_description">Reviewed on September 13 FIFA 15 remains one of the most impressively comprehensive sport simulations around, and on new-gen hardware it really 
			is the beautiful game. But while some of FIFA 15’s refinements are worthwhile – and a tangible improvement on FIFA 14 – its flaws stand out all the more. In some ways it’s a step 
			forward, in others a step back - and with Konami’s PES seemingly in resurgent form, EA Sports can’t afford to take its eye off the ball.

			<h3 class = "nominated_description_title">MLB 14: The Show</h3>
			<p class = "nominated_description">Reviewed on April 4 And those are the SportsCenter highlights. MLB 14 again offers rock-solid pitching, hitting, and fielding mechanics – and 
			multiple choices for each one. This is, yet again, a stellar baseball simulation that’s packed with enough quality game modes to occupy and entertain me for the entire season, but 
			there are few exciting new features, and online is currently a very laggy experience.

			<h3 class = "nominated_description_title">Mario Golf: World Tour</h3>
			<p class = "nominated_description">Reviewed on April 24 You don’t have to be a hardcore golf fan to get hooked on Mario Golf: World Tour. It rewards good play, gives plenty to do, 
			and is a great teacher. Its incremental approach to challenge kept me coming back to test myself, and the post-game challenges and multiplayer modes inspired me to play in new ways 
			even after I thought I was a pro.

			<h3 class = "winner_description_title">Pro Evolution Soccer 2015</h3>
			<p class = "winner_description">Reviewed on November 14 After an entire console generation in FIFA’s shadow, PES’ debut on PS4 and Xbox One is not only the best sports game of 2014, 
			but the best Pro Evolution Soccer in over a decade. It’s a return to PS2-era glory for the series, rediscovering the perfect balance between real-world authenticity and 
			knock-it-round-the-pitch purity. It’s fluid and fast, plus your opponents are genuinely smart. More importantly, PES 2015 is unpredictable – but in a good way, meaning you 
			cherish near-misses when a long-range volley glances off the crossbar just as much as enjoying watching the ball hit the back of the net.
