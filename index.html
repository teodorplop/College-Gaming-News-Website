		<h2 class = "article_source">Source:<a href="http://www.gamesradar.com/playstation-easter-sale-starts-today-mgs-going-cheep/">gamesradar</a></h2>
		<img class = "article_title_picture" src = "resources/steamworld_dig_title.jpg" alt = "SteamWorld Dig"/>
		<p>Following the revelation that an Xbox One port of SteamWorld Dig has been rated by PEGI, Image & Form CEO Brjann Sigurgeirsson has confirmed to GamesRadar+ that their critically-acclaimed Metroid/Mr Driller 
		hybrid is indeed coming to the console. The company doesn't have a firm release date yet, but they expect it to arrive on the Xbox Store by late May at the very latest.
		</p>
		<p>SteamWorld Dig began life on 3DS, but has since burrowed its way to Vita, Wii U, PS4 and PC. The Xbox One version will largely be a straight port, but with a few small differences.  Sigurgeirsson says of the port: 
		“There's a quite elaborate Easter Egg for the Xbox version - a gaming thing that we really wanted to reference. And a number of tweaks to make it overall better, although they may not stand out as giant differences. 
		Overall we prefer to keep our versions similar to each other, it keeps everybody happy.”
		</p>
		<img class = "article_picture" src = "resources/steamworld_dig0.jpg" alt = "SteamWorld Dig"/>
		<p>While I had Sigurgeirsson's ear, I asked him how difficult it had been to take a game that began life on the dinky 3DS, and upscale it to HD. “One of the guys was sitting testing the near-complete HD version when 
		I stepped into the "living room" at work just in time to see one of the new close-up animations of one of the steam-driven robots talking. I noticed there was something wrong with the character's eyes and pointed it 
		out - they seemed a bit 'swimming'”, he remembers.
		</p>
		<p>“But when I looked closely I saw tiny, tiny cogs moving behind the eyes, and was blown away by the attention to detail. I mentioned it to our art director afterwards, and he told me those cogs were actually there 
		also in the 3DS version. Which amazed me and put me off at the same time: apparently we were stuffing really detailed graphics into a 3DS game, where it was certain to be invisible.”

		<h2 class = "article_source">Source:<a href="http://www.gamesradar.com/pokemon-shuffle-passes-25-million-downloads-proves-nintendo-can-do-free-play/">gamesradar</a></h2>
		<img class = "article_title_picture" src = "resources/pokemon_shuffle_title.jpg" alt = "Pokemon Shuffle"/>
		<p>After last week’s news of Nintendo finally confirming its plans for smartphone domination with a move into mobile games it’s encouraging to see that its current free-to-play offering has been downloaded 
		over 2.5 million times on 3DS. No mean feat in just over a month. 
		</p>
		<p>Pokemon Shuffle is a match three game at heart but with a catch ‘em all reskin and is free to download onto the handheld. Every day you get five battles - each represented by one heart - where you have 
		the chance to capture a new Pokemon with your matching skills. Should you wish to play more it’s, of course, possible to purchase more hearts with Jewels.  These are bought with something considerably less sweet 
		sounding; your hard earned cash. 
		</p>
		<iframe class = "article_video" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/fSKTBNwLFnw" allowfullscreen></iframe>
		<p>As someone susceptible to the Candy Crushes of the world, I can confirm that those five hearts are just a gateway drug but it’s important to note that Jewels can be earned in game and Nintendo has previously 
		delivered some for free. There is also no impetus to keep playing other than the intense desire to match more Pokemon...
		</p>
		<p>There are no figures for what people are actually spending but as discussed by Ninty CEO Satoru Iwata last week in an interview with Time, the focus when the company moves over to smartphones is to get as many 
		people playing as possible, regardless of whether they are piling in money or not. Good news for those who were afraid Nintendo is aiming to be the next King.
		</p>
		<p>“Nintendo does not intend to choose payment methods that may hurt Nintendo’s brand image of our IP, which parents feel comfortable letting their children play with,” Iwata reassuringly said. 
		“Also, it’s even more important for us to consider how we can get as many people around the world as possible to play Nintendo smart device apps, rather than to consider which payment system will earn the most money.”
		</p>
		<img class = "article_picture" src = "resources/pokemon_shuffle0.jpg" alt = "Pokemon Shuffle"/>
		<p>In the same interview, Iwata doesn’t deny the appeal of what he prefers to call ‘free-to-start’ and says it will be used when it fits the app but promised that Nintendo won’t be watering down its much-loved 
		franchises with endless microtransactions. “The value of content generally tends to weaken in the digital world, and especially on smart devices, it is not easy to maintain the value of the content. 
		We aim to explore ways where we will not devalue Nintendo IP and rather, we can further improve the value.”
		</p>
		<p>It’s reassuring to know that Nintendo is aware of the fears of the gaming world. While the success of Pokemon Shuffle on handheld means that it’s willing to go down the free-to-play route, our smartphones shouldn’t 
		have any Animal Crossing meets Dungeon Keeper-style disasters any time soon. And you thought Resetti was bad...

		<h1 class = "article_title">Dragon Age: Inquisition single player DLC is out now on Xbox One and PC</h1>
		<h2 class = "article_source">Source:<a href="http://www.gamesradar.com/dragon-age-inquisition-single-player-dlc-out-now-xbox-one-and-pc/">gamesradar</a></h2>
		<img class = "article_title_picture" src = "resources/dragon_age_title.jpg" alt = "Dragon Age Inquisition"/>
		<p>After a leak, then a tease, EA's now committed to full-on release of Dragon Age: Inquisition's first single-player DLC pack - and I'm exactly as excited by that prospect as those semi-suggestive terms imply. 
		The Jaws of Hakkon expansion is out now on Xbox One and PC for £11.99 (I haven't been able to confirm a US price at time of writing), and is "coming soon" to every other format the game was released on last year.
		</p>
		<p><b>Warning: if you want absolutely zero spoilers, I'd suggest stopping here, for fear of terrible rage.</b>
		</p>
		<img class = "article_picture" src = "resources/dragon_age0.jpg" alt = "Dragon Age Inquisition"/>
		<p>The blurb on the Xbox One store reads thusly: "In this new adventure, playable within the Dragon Age: Inquisition campaign, you will face powerful foes, gain legendary armor and weapons, and 
		confront an ancient god of war bent on  destroying the world."
		</p>
		<p>All rather nondescript, then, but the details are a little more interesting. Mention of finding "the fate of the last Inquisitor" and visiting an Avvar tribe (if you've played the game you'll 
		remember them as the muscular chaps with big bird helmets from the Fallow Mire) point to exploring some of the lesser-mentioned facets of the game.
		</p>
		<img class = "article_picture" src = "resources/dragon_age1.jpg" alt = "Dragon Age Inquisition"/>
		<p>Both the old Inquisition and the Avvar were mere sidenotes amongst the pomp and bluster of the original journey, so it should be a neat fleshing out of the wider lore. Plus, there's a Tevinter 
		fortress to find, meaning Dorian can moan about his countrymen some more, another aspect we'd like to see more of.
		</p>
		<p>Frankly, I'll take anything Bioware have to offer when it comes to Inquisition, so that it's helping answer questions I already had is a major plus. Thedas, I'm coming home.

		<h1 class = "article_title">Gravity Rush Remaster listing spotted for PS4, keep the Vita ports coming</h1>
		<h2 class = "article_source">Source:<a href="http://www.gamesradar.com/gravity-rush-remaster-listing-spotted-ps4-keep-vita-ports-coming/">gamesradar</a></h2>
		<img class = "article_title_picture" src = "resources/gravity_rush_title.jpg" alt = "Gravity Rush"/>
		<p>Following the adventures of a young gravity-manipulating woman and a cat shaped from a starry void, Gravity Rush is still one of the coolest games on PS Vita.
			Unfortunately, not many people own a Vita, so relatively few have had the chance to float along with Kat and Dusty three years after their debut. That may be changing soon.
		</p>
		<img class = "article_picture" src = "resources/gravity_rush0.jpg" alt = "Gravity Rush"/>
		<p>The Korean Games Ratings Board has a listing for Gravity Rush Remaster on PS4, submitted for classification on March 20.
			Sony's made no mention of any plans to bring Gravity Rush to its new-gen home console - or said anything about its sequel in years,
			come to think of it - but the board has been a pretty reliable source of leaked title announcements in the past.
			I asked Sony if it can confirm the listing's legitimacy, and I'll let you know when I hear back.
		</p>
		<p>Gravity Rush is a personal favorite, but it's tough to recommend picking up a new system just for it and a couple dozen others (not even a dozen if you don't like JRPGs or indies).
			And now that Sony's ending support for Vita features like PlayStation Mobile, Maps, and parts of Near, it's looking even more grim.
			None of those features were exactly selling points before - I'm still not 100-percent sure what Near was supposed to do - though it's never a good sign when bits of the user experience start rotting off.
		</p>
		<p>But I'd be happy to point folks toward a well-made PS4 port of Gravity Rush, and Tearaway Unfolded looks great from what we've seen so far.
			I just hope the Vita-to-PS4 evacuation route doesn't stop there, because the best thing that can be done for Vita at this point is to put its games on a console people actually own.
			More than 20 million PS4s have been sold so far, and beyond Bloodborne, all their owners are looking at a relatively thin lineup of exclusive releases this year - particularly with Uncharted 4 pushed back to 2016.
			Sony could let them see what they missed on Vita and fill out the calendar at the same time.
		</p>
		<img class = "article_picture" src = "resources/gravity_rush1.jpg" alt = "Gravity Rush"/>
		<p>Gravity Rush used Vita's motion controls to make you feel like you were looking through a window into Hekseville, but PS4's far superior analog sticks could make up most of the difference.
			And its cel-shaded characters would need minimal tweaks to look great on the big screen. Similarly, Uncharted: Golden Abyss, Killzone: Mercenary, Danganronpa, and Persona 4 Golden (GR+'s pick for best Vita game)
			could all make for lovely experiences on PS4. I'd particularly like to see Freedom Wars given a second lease on life (sentence):
			its persistent online world and multiplayer battles populated by customizable convicts look novel, but it could be tough to find anyone else to play with outside of Japan.
		</p>
		<p>Digging deeper into Vita's library isn't a perfect solution; PS4 still needs more big-ticket games to keep its owners happy and court new buyers,
			and porting Vita's best games would nullify the few remaining reasons to buy the system, not to mention bringing over third-party titles like Danganronpa
			would require an external push. But Sony's already started down this path with Tearaway and (hopefully) Gravity Rush, and it's probably for the best.
		</p>
		<p>Either way, I'll continue to cherish my Vita as the slightly awkward, but still cute, PS4 Remote Play and indie machine it's grown up to become.
